Project Title: TwitterTrends
Feb-March 2012

================================================================================================================================================

Purpose:
Given a dataset of tweets recorded over some period of time, this project tries to find out trending topics and corresponding time 
using a mixture of approaches

Package Outline
******************

twittertrends				This package contains the main file: TwitterTrends.java which controls the entire module.
					Other classes are used by TwitterTrends.java accodingly.
				
twittertrends.datastr			This package contains the definitions of the various data structures used in the project.

twittertrends.preprocessing		This package contains the classes used to preprocess the data and update the relevant data structures 
					with corresponding values. The Burst.java file is used to calculate the Burst Scores which is used
					to rank potential trends.
					
twittertrends.lda			This package contains the code for Latent Dirichlet Allocation used for topic modeling of tweets.
					This code is a modified version of the LDA code provided by Phan, Cam at http://jgibblda.sourceforge.net/.
					
twittertrends.resources			This package will contain the dataset and ther resources to be used by the project. The temporary files
					to be used by LDA will also be stored here.
					
twittertrends.results			This package will contain all the results from this project, including some temporary files created
					while running the different modules of the program.

twittertrends.results.final		This package will contain the final results of the project. There will be 6 files:"finalScores_by_BurstScores_then_count" 
					& "finalScores_by_BurstScores_then_count"- give the top candidates according to the BurstScores and count along with
					the tweet dates. The other 4 files will each contain the output of the LDA performed individually on the 4 partioned
					files. Each file will have the topics and top-20 words corresponding t that topic along with the
					respective probabilities.

How To Run The Code
*********************

Import the entire code ie all packages as a Project in Eclipse. 
Place the dataset file(tab seperated format) under the resources folder. 
Inside TwitterTrends.java on Line No 25 specify the name of the dataset file.

RUNNING FOR THE FIRST TIME <On a normal machine>:
---------------------------------------------------

Due to limitations of Java Heap Size, this program will divide the dataset file into 4 parts according to the dates of the tweets.
Uncomment Line 27-30 in TwitterTrends.java to execute the Input.java code which will divide the dataset into 4 parts namely:
firstpart.txt
secondpart.txt
thirdpart.txt
fourthpart.txt
according to the dates of the tweets, and place these 4 files in the resources folder.

The 4 Threads on line 56-59 in TwitterTrends.java will then run the project for the dataset. For each part it takes approx. 15 mints. to execute, for a 20Mb(=80/4) part.


FOR RUNNING ON ADVANCED MACHINES:
------------------------------------

If you are sure that your machine will have enough Java Heap Space, then you can comment lines 57-59 and 64-71 and 114 of TwitterTrends.java
and specify your dataset name(along with relevant path) at line 56 of TwitterTrends.java.
This will run the project on the entire dataset without partioning it.

Please take note that doing this will increase the amount of time taken by the code to run by a considerable amount and may result in Insufficient memory error.


FINAL OUTPUT
--------------

The package "twittertrends.results.final" will contain the final results of the project. There will be 6 files:"finalScores_by_BurstScores_then_count" 
& "finalScores_by_BurstScores_then_count"- give the top candidates according to the BurstScores and count along with
the tweet dates. The other 4 files will each contain the output of the LDA performed individually on the 4 partioned
files. Each file will have the topics and top-20 words corresponding t that topic along with the respective probabilities.

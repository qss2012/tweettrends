How to use the Latex style for COLING-2012 

NOTE: for the authors of COLING 2012, please be aware that this year, we set up an experimental stylesheet that is optimized for on screen reading (which will be the first use of the articles). We are aware of the modification this implies to your usages, but we hope that usage will evolve for onscreen reading instead of on paper printing. The format has largely been adapted from templates of JEP-TALN 2012 conference.

Kindly note that the PDF generated from LaTeX is different from that of the Word template ONLY in the table on pages 2 & 3 where use of separate packages for a few languages might be necessary to be incorporated for LaTeX.

You will need the following files:
    coling2012.sty     conference style file provided

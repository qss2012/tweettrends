[1] presents a Burst Detection mechanish to detect trends. I have tried to incorporate this algorithm in my implementation.
[2]. [4] & [5] discuss the various appoaches centered around LDA for topic modeling for Twitter.
[3] discusses 3 Topic Modeling schemes: MSG, USER and TERM. I have incprporated the TERM schemes in my implementation using the basic LDA code provided by
Phan, Cam at http://jgibblda.sourceforge.net/.

[7] presents a different approach which would involve querying a search engine for a search query derived from a tweet to get the topic
for any particular tweet. Initially I thought of including this module as well, but because of scalability and time issues, I couldn't work on it.
